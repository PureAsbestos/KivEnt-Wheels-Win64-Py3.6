# KivEnt-Wheels-Win64-Py3.6
Binary wheels for Cymunk and the Kivent packages. (Windows 64-bit, Python 3.6)

The Kivent (and Cymunk) packages are pretty hard to compile on Windows, so I have uploaded wheels for them compatible with a Windows 64-bit installation of Python 3.6 for anyone having similar issues.
